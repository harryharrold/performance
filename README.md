performance
===========
This is the repo where myself and Rupert Redington nailed together our keynote for the 2015 http://www.nordevcon.com/ 
First thing we did was wrote the session title and pitch, and started reading round the subject. That material is mainly in "The Dump" at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/wiki/The-dump - augmented by a lists of notes from a session at UK Gpvcamp - http://lanyrd.com/2015/ukgc15/sdhffx/ A couple of days stacking up post-it notes got us a list of things to say, then a couple of days of purest keybpard bashing got us to the session sections at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/wiki/ From there, we moved to the full text to https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/FullText.md so we could hammer at the text properly. Tha then made it into a cuelist at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/cuelist.md - all image CC-BY licensed for commercial use, althugh we need to be clearer about referencing ownership.

If you simply want to read what we _meant_ to say: https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/FullText.md
