===========
This is the repo where myself and Rupert Redington nailed together our keynote for the 2015 http://www.nordevcon.com/ 

If you simply want to read what we _meant_ to say: https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/FullText.md

The actual presentation was delivered using a folder of images, which we displayed as the background to a greenscreen'ed board on which we slapped post-it notes to make any points we needed to write down.

The closest we have to a "slide deck" is the cue list at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/cuelist.md

If you'd like to see the images we used, they're (unordered) at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/tree/master/images

How we wrote it, for what it's worth.

First thing we did was wrote the session title and pitch, and started reading round the subject. That material is mainly in "The Dump" at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/wiki/The-dump - augmented by a lists of notes from a session at UK Gpvcamp - http://lanyrd.com/2015/ukgc15/sdhffx/ A couple of days stacking up post-it notes got us a list of things to say, then a couple of days of purest keybpard bashing got us to the session sections at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/wiki/ From there, we moved to the full text to https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/FullText.md so we could hammer at the text properly. Tha then made it into a cuelist at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance/blob/master/cuelist.md - all image CC-BY licensed for commercial use, althugh we need to be clearer about referencing ownership.
